<span style="font-size:45px; line-height:15px;">M</span>y journey from being a normal boy to a wise poet is really interesting. <br>
I used to wonder how writers and poets compose such great peices of art, 
<br>but it seems easy to me now. I never thought i would be able 
<br>to write poetry, but today I have more than 200 poems in my diary.

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:15px;">I</span>
 was in 10th standard when I wrote my first ever motivational poem.
<br>It was my first ever poem in English language, though I had written some 
<br>poems in Punjabi language. That poem lit a spark in me and my poetic life 
<br>began. I believe the fire which that spark lit in me still burns. I was already 
<br>in love and had a broken heart. So everything just got mixed and this gave rise 
<br>to a poet in me. Within one year from then, I wrote only 2 to 3 poems since life 
<br>became better after i left the school on completing 10th grade. I started my 
<br>higher studies at another school where I fell in love again. Amd again I got 
<br>heartbroken after being rejected. By then I had become lonely with no friends 
<br>at all. But then, I found a lost friend, poetry. I started writing just to make 
<br>myself feel better and that helped me a lot. I was in depression and used to have 
<br>mood swings, so poetry became a bestfriend of mine. Time went on and I started 
<br>writing poetry like professional poets, then came in my mind the idea to create 
<br>an instagram blog. Since then ( April 2018 ), I have been posting all my poetry 
<br>on my instagram page and it has touched hearts of thousands. This love from those 
<br>who read and appreciate my work makes me write more and more. When unknown people
<br>praise my poetry by messaging me on instagram, I feel extremely happy. And when 
<br>people love my poems, I too feel like being loved. My poems gather love for me, 
<br>which I myself could never do .
